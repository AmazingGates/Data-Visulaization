Data-Visulaization

We will be going over the Process of Data Visualization.

We Will now get into visualizing our dataset, and visualizing elements in our dataset.

First we will start by picking out the image and the label, and image rates.

Then we will pass in the train dataset. We can also pass in the validation dataset and test dataset.

Then we will specifiy how many elements we want to take using a .take(). (We chose 16 for example purposes)

Next we will come up with subplots.

And there we pick out 4 by 4, because we have a plot with 16 different images.

Next we will use plt.imshow of our image

We will also use plt.title to title our labels for each image.

So that's how we plot our image.

And finally we will run our code.
